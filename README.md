## What is Flair?
Flair is an application born in the time of COVID to help people endure quarantine. We wanted to create a way for people to engage with one another socially in a fun way.  

Flair is a video sharing application where people can showcase their talents and challenge others to do the same! Users record themselves performing their talent or skill, and upload the video. Other users can then attempt the challenge and record themselves doing the challenge.

## Who made Flair? Meet the team!
Flair was created by a team of BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology) students:
* Asher Gumunyu
* Benjamin Chin
* Francis Sapanta
* Saksham Bhardwaj


## How can I contribute?
Configuring your environment to begin contributing is simple! Just follow these easy steps
* Clone the repository
* Install node if you haven't already (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* On Windows OS, you'll need to open the node.js command line. On mac or linux, the regular command line will work.
* In the command line, change directories to the repository folder and run "npm install"

That's it! All the required packages will be installed.  

We use Firebase for our database, but luckily Firebase authentication is already a part of the firebaseConfig.js file, so you'll be able to start coding already. If you would like to work on the database, reach out to Asher Gumunyu who will be able to give you access.
